I"'<p>This time Iâ€™m trying to understand protocols. To be honest, Iâ€™ve never heard about protocols till today, butÂ I wanted this knowlege, so I studied, and hereâ€™s the result ðŸ˜Š</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-multimethods-and-protocols">Why do we need Multimethods and Protocols?</h2>

<p>In Clojure, and in functional languages in general, there are multiple ways to adapt functions to various types (in our case it will be animals). If we need to adapt function to various types, we usually use conditions (if, cond..), and if we want to add new behavior for another type, we need to touch part of code where types are distinguished.</p>

<p>I have a function</p>

<p>and I decided to find out something about Pumpkin and adopt him</p>

<p>I need to add a map for pumpkin, into map of animals and an â€˜animal languageâ€™ into tell-me-about-animal function (this animal sound is located in this function because all cats have the same language, so it doesnâ€™t make sense to write it with every new cat, or dog .. )</p>
