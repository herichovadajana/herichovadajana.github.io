    I feel like I should properly introduce myself here, so here we go :relaxed: :wave: .
    <br>

    <br>
    My name is Dajana. I'm 30 years old, and live in Austria with my husband and two kids.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have always been fascinated by mathematics and logic, and since I was in elementary school, I knew I would love to pursue a career where I could use them. But life happened, and I didn't have a chance to go to university and study what I loved. Therefore I ended up in the bank industry for a few years.
    <br>
    <br>
    Then I met my now-husband. He was a Clojure developer, and I immediately fell in love with what he was doing (and with him, of course :) ). So when he offered to show me the programming world, I immediately left my job and started to learn. I spent my whole days and months learning Clojure and I was thrilled. I finally felt I knew what I wanted to do with my life. This time I was also writing and documenting my learning on my blog clojuregirl.com (it doesn't exist anymore). <br>
    After one year of learning, I landed my first job as a Clojure developer and learned even more. When the project ended, I started to work at scalac.io, which I can say was the best job a junior developer can imagine. I worked on an exciting open-source project with super talented and helpful people. Literally a dream job.
    <br>
    But life happened again, and I was expecting our first baby :)
    <br>
    <br>
    As a mom, I wanted to spend time with my baby and be there for her. Therefore I had to pause my career for a while. And for practical reasons, we had an immediately second one (to have this crazy baby/toddler time behind as soon as possible) :D
    <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, my husband switched from programming to the 3D printing business. He created a 3D modeling and slicing software called <a href="https://github.com/janherich/chisel">chisel</a>.
    <br>
    So during my time on parental leave, I was using Clojure primarily for creating models for 3D printers (this is something I plan to write blog posts about because it's a fascinating topic).
    <br>
    <br>
    And now, when my kids are old enough, I can continue my dream career as a Clojure developer. <br>
    I'm so happy that I can finally work on improving my programming skills and become the best developer I can be. I plan to use this blog to write about the topics I find interesting or were challenging to understand when I started with Clojure (so I promise I will try to explain it in the easiest way possible).
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm looking forward to this journey, and I hope you will enjoy this blog as much as I'm enjoying writing it :heart:
    <br>
    <br>
    And also, I'm a very bad triathlete :D
